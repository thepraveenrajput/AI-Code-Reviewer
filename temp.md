❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){ return a+b;}
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ `a` and `b` are not defined within the function scope, leading to potential errors or reliance on global variables.
* ❌ The function doesn't accept any arguments, limiting its reusability.
* ❌ Missing JSDoc comments

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
/**
* Calculates the sum of two numbers.
*
* @param {number} a - The first number.
* @param {number} b - The second number.
* @returns {number} The sum of a and b.
*/
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:

* ✔️ The function now accepts two arguments `a` and `b`, making it more flexible and reusable.
* ✔️ Added a JSDoc style comment block to explain what the function does, the parameters it accepts, and what it
returns.
* ✔️ The function now correctly sums the provided arguments.
